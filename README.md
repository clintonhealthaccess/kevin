DHSST
===

The DHSST is an integrated web-based system whose main goal is to help administrations such as
governments collect and analyze information as well as plan. For more information and documentation, visit [dhsst.org][dhsst.org].


Installation
---

To install and run the DHSST, simply clone the git repository and run

	grails run-app

Grails 2.1.0 has to be installed. We recommend using [gvm][gvm] to install grails:

	gvm install grails 2.1.0
	
DHSST will run fine using the default configuration on the development environment. If you want to run DHSST in production with your own configuration, there are a few steps needed.

Production configuration
---

These are the configuration paramters that need to be set when using the site on a production server. When launching the site in production, the application will look for a file named ```<user_home>/.grails/kevin-config.groovy``` and use that configuration to override the default one.

### Data source configuration

The production data source is configured to use a MySQL database and schema by default. If you are fine with that, then here are the settings you should set:

	dataSource.url="jdbc:mysql://<url>:<port>/<db_name>"
	dataSource.username="<username>"
	dataSource.password="<password>"
	
The application has only been tested with a MySQL database. However if you want to use another database at your own risk. Check the [grails documentation][grails-doc] for instructions on how to configure it.

Introduction
---

DHSST is an analytical tool. It takes some data about certain data locations (could be a health center, a hospital, a school), and offers tool to display, manipulate and aggregate them along a certain location hierarchy (could be a country-province-district structure for example).
location. 

To understand this manual, it is important to know how the [location plugin][chai-locations] and [data plugin][chai-kevin-data] work. Please go through those readme first.
	
Data entry
---

Data can be entered into the system either by using the integrated survey tool, or by using the import functionality of the site.
	
### Survey

Data can be entered using the survey part of the site. The survey, instance of **Survey** class, is broken down into programs (**SurveyProgram** class), sections (**SurveySection** class) and questions (**SurveyQuestion** cf. below). A program contains several sections and each section can have 1 or more questions. A section is set as complete when all questions in the section are completed and valid. A program is set as complete when all sections in the program are complete.

All questions are linked to one or several **raw data elements** through a **FormElement**. When a user fills in a survey, values entered as saved as **FormEnteredValue**. When a section is submitted, all the values saved in **FormEnteredValue** are saved in the **RawDataElementValue**. It is important to understand the difference between unsubmitted and submitted section. Only when a section is submitted, do the values entered become available as **RawDataElementValue**. Before that, they are stored as **FormEnteredValue** and only available through the survey API and not through the [data plugin API][chai-kevin-data].

**FormElement** are therefore the survey equivalent of a **RawDataElement**, and **FormEnteredValue** the equivalent of **RawDataElementValue**. A **FormElement** holds a relationship to its corresponding **RawDataElement** and adds additional functionality in that it can also store corresponding *validation rules* and *skip rules* (see below for explanation), and a **FormEnteredValue** information on whether the value entered is valid or not, or whether it has been skipped. Validation and skip rules will be explained later.

A survey is linked to a certain **Period** via the *period* property. There can be several surveys for one period. When a value is copied, the *period* property from the survey is used as the raw data element value period. The diagram below explains what happens when values are copied:

	FormElement								RawDataElement
	|	|										|
	|	|										|
	|	FormEnteredValue - > (submit) - >	RawDataElementValue
	|		- value				->				- value
	|		- dataLocation		->				- dataLocation
	|
	Survey
		- period				->				- period

There can be more than one survey associated to one period, but one survey can be associated to only one period. Therefore to enter data for another period, one must use a different survey entirely.

All entities mentioned above can be assigned to one or more data location types, making them available or not to certain types. **It is therefore possible to create a different survey for each location type or group of data location types for the same period.**

#### Survey questions

There are 3 types of questions, **simple** questions, **checkbox** questions and **table** questions. All question types inherit the **SurveyQuestion** abstract class.

##### Simple Questions

Simple questions feed results to one data element, they are instances of the **SurveySimpleQuestion** class, which links to the corresponding **FormElement**.

If simple questions are associated to a data element of type ```list```, it means the user will be able to add or remove elements of the list from the survey itself. 

This allows the user to enumarete a list of item in the survey, for example the list of all staff. Let's say we have a data element of the following type :

	- list (type: map)
		- first_name: string
		- last_name: string
		- age: number

Defining a simple question associated to that data element will create on the survey what is commonly called a *nominative table*, i.e. a list of staff, where items (in this case individual staff members) can be added or removed and whose first name, last name and birthday can be specified using individual fields.

If the simple question is linked to a data element of type ```list``` or ```map```, then the labels of the individual fields are found in **FormElement** *formElementHeadersMap* one-to-many relationship using **FormElementHeaderMap** object whose *header* field gives the path to the individual field in the type (cf. [data plugin README][chai-kevin-data] *Type* section), and *names* is the label. In this example, we could define the following header maps :

	header				names[en]		names[fr]
	------				---------		---------
	[_].first_name		First name		Pr√©nom	
	[_].last_name		Last name		Nom
	[_].age				Age				Age

##### Checkbox Questions

Checkbox questions feed results to one or more raw data elements of type bool and displays them as a list of checkbox options. The question itself is an instance of a **SurveyCheckboxQuestion** class and has a one-to-many relationship with **SurveyCheckboxOption**, which link to the corresponding **FormElement**. A survey checkbox option can only take form elements whose corresponding raw data element is of type ```bool```.

##### Table Questions

Table questions feed results to several data elements arranged in rows and columns. The question is an instance of the **SurveyTableQuestion** class and it has several **SurveyTableColumn** and **SurveyTableRow**. The **SurveyTableRow** object contains a map ```<SurveyTableColumn, FormElement>``` that links a certain column for a row to a certain form element. Each cell of the table therefore links to a different **FormElement** and therefore to a different **RawDataElement**.

#### Submitting a survey section

When a section is submitted, all values are copied from the **FormEnteredValue** to the corresponding **RawDataElementValue**. All values that are valid are copied as is, values that are invalid or skipped are set as a ```null``` value. The table below summarizes the different cases.

	FormEnteredValue			-			RawDataElementValue
	----------------						-------------------
	- value entered and valid				- value is copied
	- value entered and invalid				- value is set to null 
	- value not entered						- value is set to null
	- value skipped							- value is set to null

The *period* property of the **RawDataElementValue** is set to the period referred to by the survey, as explined above, and the *dataLocation* to whichever data location is filling out the survey.

After a section has been submitted, the values are saved as **RawDataElementValue** and therefore available to the reports (cf. below) component of the site.

#### Cloning a survey

TODO

#### Validation

On the survey, validation rules can be defined for individual fields. Those are instances of **FormValidationRule** and are attached to a **FormElement** and a certain *prefix*, indicating which field the rule applies on. A validation rule contains an expression. If the expression evaluates to ```false```, the field will be invalid and the *error message* defined in the rule will be displayed underneath the field.

The *expression* in the validation rule can refer to any **FormElement** using the syntax ```$<form_element_id>```. Let's use the example of staff above, and we'll put a validation rule on the ```age``` field that it should be bigger than 0 but smaller than 100. Let's say the FormElement has id ```13```:

	FormElement		expression				message[en]
	-----------		----------				-----------
	13				$13[_].age > 0 			The age must be between 0 and 100.
					and $13[_].age < 100

An expression doesn't necessarily have to refer to the form element to which the validation rule is attached. It can refer to any form element, also to a form element belonging to another survey. This way, it is possible to create a validation rule that refers to another year's survey. Using the same example, let's say we create a validation rule for the survey of the year after, saying that the age should have increased by 1. Let's say the form element for the new survey has id ```26```:

	FormElement		expression				message[en]
	-----------		----------				-----------
	26				$26[_].age 				The age must have increased by 1.
					== $13[_].age + 1

If the *allowOutlier* flag is set on a validation rule, then the user will have to possibility to click on a link to ignore the validation rule. The text "If you are sure this is correct, click here." will appear after the message.

#### Skip rules

The logic behind skip rules is almost the same as for validation rules, except skip rules are attached directly to a survey and can apply to more than one form element or question at the same time. A skip rule contains an *expression*. When that expression evaluates to true, the *formSkipRuleElementMaps* and *skippedQuestions* properties define what form element and what questions are skipped.

If a form element is skipped, a comma-delimited list of path can be specified. This allows one to target a specific field inside a complex type. Let's take the example above with form element ```13``` and define a skip rule that skips the age question if the first name is ```Susan```.

	expression			formElement		skippedFormElements
	----------			-----------		-------------------
	$13[_].first_name	13				[_].age
	== "Susan"
