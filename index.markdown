What is the DHSST?
==================

The DHSST is an integrated web-based system whose main goal is to help administrations such as governments **collect** and **analyze** information as well as **plan**.
- It contains a [survey tool](#survey) that helps collect data
- It contains a [reporting tool](#reporting) that clearly displays data in order to identify infrastructure and service gaps
- It contains a [planning tool](#planning) that integrates information coming from either the survey or other sources with user entered information

For more information, refer to the [user documentation](TODO).

The system is flexible and can be customized by an administrator without requiring any technical expertise.
- The survey questions, the reports and planning budget and output can be entered and edited by the administrator
- The reports can be based either on survey data and on other sources through an import/export mechanism
- The data can be manipulated and aggregated using a calculation/aggregation engine

You can find out more about this in the [administrator documentation](TODO).

It is currently used by the [Rwanda Ministry of Health](http://www.moh.gov.rw) (implementation accessible [here](http://www.districthealth.moh.gov.rw)) and the software is available for free under the BSD license for anyone to use and [modify](TODO).

Survey

The survey tool is here to help you collect data. The survey tool features :
- the ability to collect data of different types (text, values, option from a dropdown menu), including lists (if you want to collect - say - the list of all the medical equipment in a health facility)
- validation based on rules defined by the administrator that can refer to other fields
- skip patterns based on rules defined by the administrator

Reporting
---------

The reports help analyze the information for evidence-based decision. Currently there are 3 different reports available:
- A Dashboard that gives an overview of the performance for different indicators
- A District Summary Report that displays various indicator
- A Facility Count Table that helps identify gaps

Planning
--------

The planning tool integrates information coming from various sources to offer a detailed budget and different administrator-defined output for the facilities.
